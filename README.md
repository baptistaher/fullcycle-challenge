# FullCycle Challenge 
This repository is a **collection of project**, **experiments**, and **reference implementations**  built during the **FullCycle** journey.

The goal is to learn and explore **software architecture**, **backend engineering**, **distributed systems**, and **best practices** through practical examples.



Each folder focuses on a **specific architecture style**, **pattern**, or **technology**, serving both as a learning and a reference for real-world systems.



## Project Overview
### Architecture & Design
- **Clean Architecture** - Implementation following Clean Architecture principles: separation of concerns, use cases, entities, and frameworks and details.
- **Hexagonal Architecture** - Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) architecture emphasizing domain isolation and testability
- **DDD(Domain-Driven Design)** - Tactical DDD concepts such as Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Repositories, and Domain Services. 
- **c4** - C4 model diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code) to document system architecture visually
- **Solid** - Practical examples applying the SOLID principles in real codebases

### Communication & Integration
- **Communication Systems** - Experiments and implementations of inter-service comunaction patterns. (review this)
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** - Event-base system showcasing asynchronous communication and loose coupling
- **Kafka** - Apache Kafka examples covering producers, consumers, topics and messaging patterns
- **rabbitmq** - Message broker usage with queues, exchanges

## System Styles

- **Monolithic** - Traditional monolithic application architecture for comparison and baseline understanding.

- **MS (Microservices)** - Microservices-based systems focusing on service boundaries, communication, and scalability.

## Security & Identity

- **Keycloak** - Authentication and authorization examples using Keycloak (OIDC, OAuth2, SSO).

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Docker** - Containerization examples, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose setups for local development.

- **Observabilidade** - Observability practices including logging, metrics, and tracing (monitoring-ready systems).

## Code Quality & Tooling

- **Codeflex** - Flexible code structures and experiments around maintainability and extensibility.

## Goals of This Repository

- Apply theory in practice

- Compare architectural styles side-by-side

- Build production-inspired systems

- Serve as a personal knowledge base

- Act as reference material for future projects
